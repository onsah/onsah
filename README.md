# Onur Sahin
* Last year Computer Science student.
* Part time software engineer
* I'm interested in programming languages design, interpreters, compilers. Basically anything related to defining and executing a software. You can check my first languge from [here](https://github.com/onsah/Flux_rs)
* I'm am also interested in native desktop applications. [This](https://github.com/onsah/SyncLyrics) Gtk application shows the lyrics of the song played in the spotify.
* In the future I want to contribute open source projects related to my interests. Such as Rust language or any tooling related to Rust, or collobrating to Gnome or ElementaryOS development.
* In my free time I want to learn about compilers and static analytic
